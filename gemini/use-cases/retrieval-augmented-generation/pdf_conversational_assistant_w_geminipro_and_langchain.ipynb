This APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate. APR for Cash Advances 29.99% This APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate. Penalty APR and When it Applies 29.99% This APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate. This APR may be applied to new transactions on your account if: 1) you make one or more late payments; or 2) your payment is returned by your bank We may also consider your creditworthiness in determining whether or not to apply the penalty APR to your Account. How Long Will the Penalty APR Apply? If the Penalty APR is applied, it will apply for at least 6 months. We review your Account every 6 months after the Penalty APR is applied. The Penalty APR will continue to apply until after you have made timely payments, with no returned payments during the 6 months being reviewed.\\n\\nPaying Interest\\n\\nYour due date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing period. We will not charge you interest on purchases if you pay each month your entire balance (or if you have a plan outstanding, your balance adjusted for plans) by the due date. We will begin charging interest on cash advances on the transaction date.\\n\\nhttps://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card-application/apply/prospect/terms/hilton-honors-aspire-credit-card/28009-10-0#offer-terms\\n\\n1/18\\n\\nTerms, Conditions & Disclosures\\n\\n1/18/24, 1:04 PM\\n\\nPlan Fee (Fixed Finance Charge) Up to 1.33% of each purchase moved into a plan based on the plan duration, the APR that would otherwise apply to the purchase and other factors.

The Wall Street Journal may not publish the Prime Rate on that day. If it does not, we will use the Prime Rate from the previous day it was published. If the Prime Rate increases, Variable APRs will increase. In that case, you may pay more interest and have a higher Minimum Payment Due. When the Prime Rate changes, the resulting changes to variable APRs take effect as of the first day of the billing period. Variable APRs are accurate as of 01/18/24.\\n\\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\nView the full Card Member Agreement .\\n\\nhttps://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card-application/apply/prospect/terms/hilton-honors-aspire-credit-card/28009-10-0#offer-terms\\n\\n2/18\\n\\n1/18/24, 1:04 PM\\n\\nTerms, Conditions & Disclosures\\n\\nBy submitting this application, you are requesting us to open an Account in your name and to issue Card(s) as you direct.

For a booking to be eligible for a statement credit, the booking must be made directly through a reservation channel operated by Hilton. Bookings or purchases made through a third party other than Hilton, such as an online travel website, will not be eligible for statement credit(s). At certain hotels, if your booking is part of a contract for an event, the purchase may not be eligible for a statement credit. For an incidental charge (including charges made at restaurants, spas, and other establishments within the hotel property) to be eligible for a statement credit, the incidental charge must be charged to your room and paid for with your Hilton Honors American Express Surpass Card at checkout.\\n\\nEligible purchases can be made by both the Basic and any Additional Card Members on the Card Account. However, the total amount of statement credits for eligible purchases will not exceed $200 per Card Account per calendar year. Please allow 8-12 weeks after the eligible purchase is charged to your Card Account for statement credit(s) to be posted to the Account. Please call American Express at the number on the back of your Card if statement credits have not posted after 12 weeks from the date of purchase. To receive this benefit, your Card account must not be cancelled or past due at the time of statement credit fulfillment. Statement credit(s) may not be received or may be reversed if the purchase is cancelled or modified, or if you engage in abuse or misuse in connection with the benefit.\\n\\nAmerican Express relies on the merchant's processing of transactions to determine the transaction date. The transaction date may differ from the date you made the purchase if, for example, there is a delay in the merchant submitting the transaction to us or if the merchant uses another date as the transaction date. This means that in some cases your purchase may not earn the statement credit benefit for the benefit period in which you made the purchase. For example, if an eligible purchase is made on December 31st but the merchant processes the transaction such that it is identified to us as occurring on January 1st, the January statement credit would be applied. American Express also relies on information provided to us by the merchant to identify eligible purchases. If American Express does not receive information that identifies your transaction as eligible for this benefit, the Basic Card Member will not receive the statement credit. For example, your purchase will not be eligible if it is not made directly with Hilton (e.g., if a purchase is made at a restaurant or convenience store within a Hilton property). Basic Card Members may not receive the statement credit if we receive inaccurate information or are otherwise unable to identify your purchase as eligible, if a transaction is made with an electronic wallet or through a third party (such as an app store), or if the merchant uses a mobile or wireless card reader to process it.\\n\\nAccount Manager Account Managers must be at least 18 years old and have a U.S. Mailing Address and Social Security Number.\\n\\nhttps://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card-application/apply/prospect/terms/hilton-honors-surpass-credit-card/28009-10-0#offer-terms\\n\\n5/16\\n\\n1/18/24, 1:03 PM\\n\\nTerms, Conditions & Disclosures\", metadata={'source': 'gs://vertexai-l300-capstone-bucket/AMEX_HHonor_Surpass_CC.pdf'}), Document(page_content='5/16\\n\\n1/18/24, 1:03 PM\\n\\nTerms, Conditions & Disclosures\\n\\nAmerican Express Access Access tickets may be purchased by American Express Card Members for select events and select seats, during a specified period.

In applying any limit we will not take into account any credits (such as for returned merchandise or for payments), even if a credit relates to a Purchase made by the Additional Card Member. Any request that we change a limit may not be effective until a subsequent billing period. Any Charges (as defined below) incurred by the Additional Card Member prior to the date during a billing period that we apply the limit will not be subject to the limit for that billing period.\\n\\nBecause of systems or administrative considerations, arrangements with merchants, or for other business reasons, we may, but are not required to, treat some Purchases and/or cash access transactions (collectively, Charges) as not being subject to any such limits. You agree to pay all Charges without regard to whether any Charges exceed a limit, and you agree that we are not liable to you or any other person when a limit is not applied to any Charges and/or when Charges are incurred and billed that exceed a limit. While we typically require merchants to obtain an authorization for purchases and submit final transaction documentation for payment in a timely manner, a limit may not apply or may be exceeded when a merchant does not obtain an authorization for any reason; when a merchant obtains an authorization for a partial amount of the final charge submitted to us for payment; or when such submissions are not submitted or processed at the same time that the authorization is obtained. Examples may include, but are not limited to: Charges made outside of the U.S., in duty-free stores, or on board airplanes or cruise vessels; international airline ticket Purchases; vehicle rentals; lodging stays extended beyond original reservation period; certain mail order Purchases; Purchases billed on a recurring basis; Purchases at gas stations; telecommunications charges, including charges incurred with calling cards; taxicab charges; security deposits; late, damage or other fees in connection with rentals; Purchases billed in installments; restaurant tips and other gratuities; and Charges that occur before the end of billing period, if the Charge is posted to your Account after the Closing Date of that billing period. Any limit will not be applied to Charges for foreign currency or for travelers cheques or gift cheques obtained other than by telephone from us.\\n\\nThe Spending Limit for the Additional Card Member(s) is optional. If no Spending Limit is set on the Additional Card, spending capacity on this Card will be subject to the Basic Card Member's account terms and conditions.\\n\\nThe American Express Auto Purchasing Program Disclosure The Upfront Price Offer represents the personalized price that a Certified Dealer offers for a specific in-stock VIN that closely matches the vehicle you configured.
